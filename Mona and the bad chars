#bad char discovery in immunity using Mona.py

#Step1
#Set working folder for reference

!mona config -set workingfolder c:\logs\%p

#Step2
#Create a byte array, which will need to go in your buffer after your break point and ESP offset value

!mona bytearray 

#Step2.5
#edit bytearray to remove 00 and 40 to save time

!mona bytearray -cpb "\x00\x40"

#Step3
#Insert the bytearray into your POC after your breakpoint and EIP space, fill the rest of your buffer and test

!mona compare -f C:\logs\...\bytearray.bin -a %ESPVALUE

##The time saving trick is that in the mona memory comparison results, consecutive numbers may be a false positive when only the first value is bad.
#If you see 04,05,06 for example, chances are only 04 is the bad character. Remove 04 and rerun to test.

#Step4
#update bytearray to remove bad chars

!mona bytearray -cpb "\x??\x??"

#repeat steps 3 and 4 until the memory comparison result is clean.
